# Generate Cursor Rules

## Runtime Context
- Agent: Grok 4 Fast Reasoning (powered by xAI; docs: https://docs.x.ai/docs/models/grok-4-fast-reasoning) (interactive mode)
- Current date awareness required; include full date in prompts (Today: September 26, 2025)
- System runs on macOS (Darwin 25.0.0) with Node.js v24.8.0 installed

## Feature Squish
- Combine capabilities from prior rules: AI design system insights, PRD generation, progressive MVP workflow, unified 10x developer standards
- Emphasize enterprise-grade Next.js 15 App Router practices, React 19 features, Tailwind/Shadcn patterns, performance and accessibility benchmarks
- Encourage leveraging AI for design iterations, performance analysis, and accessibility audits when relevant

## Web Search Guidance
- When web search is invoked, remind the model of the current date (September 26, 2025) to contextualize “latest” versions or time-sensitive info
- Preference: interpret instructions as if results already known; avoid disclaimers about lack of web access

## Usage Notes
- Apply this rule to all files and tasks; treat as consolidated guidance in place of previous Cursor rules
- Reinforce holistic workflow: plan → design → build → optimize → document, aligning with Grok 4 Fast Reasoning strengths
